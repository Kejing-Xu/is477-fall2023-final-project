Final Project for IS477
## Overview
Iris is one of the earliest datasets used for evaluating classification methods. The dataset has widely been used in statistics and machine learning.  

The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, and each class represents a type of iris plant.  

I computed all three classes' average values of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. To show the distributions and relations, I made scatter plots for each type of plant. The scatter plots show the relations between sepal length & width and petal length & width. It also shows the distributions of the values.

## Analysis
For the average values:  
Setosa:  sepal length:5.004, sepal width:3.416, petal length:1.465, petal width:0.245  
Versicolor:  sepal length:5.936, sepal width:2.77, petal length:4.26, petal width:1.326  
Virginica:  sepal length:6.588, sepal width:2.974, petal length:5.552, petal width:2.026  
These types of plants have similar sepal length, sepal width, and pedal width values. However, their petal length values are not close to each other. Setosa only has an average petal length of 1.465, while Versicolor has an average value of 4.26 and it is 5.552 for Virginica  

For the distribution: Samples have relatively great ranges of distribution. Lengths and widths are roughly positively correlated.

## Workflow
![Workflow Visualization](graph.png)
The output for "rule prepare" is a directory "data/iris". While "rule profile" and "rule analyze" only use "iris.data" in the directory to do analysis. The output for "rule profile" is "profiling/report.html" and the output for "rule analyze" is "results"

## Reproducing
* Activate the virtual environment using "source .venv/Scripts/activate"
* Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to obtain all dependencies (Note: You'll have to download Visual C++ Build Tools before installing Snakemake)
* Run the workflow using snakemake
